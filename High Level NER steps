General Steps for Named Entity Recognition (this is from the nltk site)
-Tokenize the text into sentences (list of sentences)
-Tokenize the sentences into words (list of sentences that are a list of words)
-Tag the words with parts of speach tags (usually uses a machine learning algorithm-- N-grams, brill, etc.)
-Use the POS tags to break the sentences into Noun Phrase Chunks (supervised version can use n-grams, bayes classifiers, etc.)
-last then entities are identified from the noun phrases (this is sometimes done with a look up dictionary, but can be done with a classifier as well)
