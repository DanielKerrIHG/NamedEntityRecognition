General Steps for Named Entity Recognition (this is from the nltk site)
-Tokenize the text into sentences (list of sentences)
-Tokenize the sentences into words (list of sentences that are a list of words)
-Tag the words with parts of speach tags (usually uses a machine learning algorithm-- N-grams, brill, etc.)
  //So-- do we spend time working on semi/un supervised methods for some of the intermediate steps? If so:
  //A couple of papers that talk about semi-supervised algoritms for POS tagging:

  //Unsupervised tagging:
  //http://www.computing.dcu.ie/~asrivastava/docs/UnsupervisedPOS.pdf
-Use the POS tags to break the sentences into Noun Phrase Chunks (supervised version can use n-grams, bayes classifiers, etc.)
-last then entities are identified from the noun phrases (this is sometimes done with a look up dictionary, but can be done with a classifier as well)
-Evaluate success
