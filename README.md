**Start here**, this describes the steps for NER: http://www.nltk.org/book3/ch07.html
Background information can be found in chapters 3 and 5. ALSO
 there is source code here: http://www.nltk.org/ 
 source code for NER chunker: https://code.google.com/p/nltk/source/browse/trunk/nltk/nltk/chunk/named_entity.py
-- tagger code info: http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tag.html#module-nltk.tag.stanford

* This is using a C# tool, but I thought the description of hidden markov modeling was good:
http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/541428/Sequence-Classifiers-in-Csharp-Part-I-Hidden-Marko

* Here is an academic paper that talks about a semi-supervised learning algorithm for chunking. (As an aside, on page six there is a list of features they used for NER, something that I had been trying to find for a while):

* Powerpoint discussing semi-supervised algorithms. I'll look for a better source of info:
http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/pub/sslchicago09.pdf

* another powerpoint discussing SSL, from the same source. Seems meatier than the one above:
http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/pub/acl08tutorial.pdf

* A paper on Unsupervised chunking:
http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P11/P11-1108.pdf

* Blog from one of the authors of nltk, this entry discussing chunker training:
http://streamhacker.wordpress.com/2008/12/29/how-to-train-a-nltk-chunker/

* Lingpipe is an NLP implementation with NER module. It has a book associated with it (much like the nltk)
http://alias-i.com/lingpipe-book/lingpipe-book-0.5.pdf
  * Ch. 6 is about character lang. models, Ch. 7 is about tokenized language models, ch 9 is about classifiers has 
  * useful information about scoring classifier performance, Ch 10 is bayes classifier, ch 11 is about tagging...

* Textbook with lots of information about language processing
http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/mohit/Speech-and-Language-Processing.pdf


* possible availiable corpii for use in project:
